Of course! Here is a clear, step-by-step guide written for the CTF player who has received your challenge. You can give this directly to them as a hint or a full walkthrough.

### **Walkthrough: Solving "The Hidden Communiqu√©"**

This guide will walk you through the process of finding the flag hidden inside `challenge_image.jpg`.

#### **Challenge Briefing Recap:**

*   **Objective:** Find a secret message in an image.
*   **Key Clue:** The password is the agent's callsign: `AlphaEcho7`.
*   **File:** `challenge_image.jpg`

This is a classic steganography problem, where data is hidden within another file. The password clue strongly suggests we need a tool that can use a password to extract data. A very common tool for this is `steghide`.

---

### **Step 1: Get the Necessary Tools**

First, you need to have `steghide` installed on your system. If you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu, you can install it with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install steghide
```

### **Step 2: Investigate the Image**

Before trying to extract anything, a good first step is to see if `steghide` can even detect any hidden data. This confirms if we're on the right track.

Run the `steghide info` command on the challenge file:

```bash
steghide info challenge_image.jpg
```

The program will prompt you for a password.

```
Enter passphrase:
```

Enter the password from the challenge description: `AlphaEcho7`

If the password is correct, you will see output confirming that there is an embedded file. It will look something like this:

```
"challenge_image.jpg":
  format: jpeg
  capacity: 23.9 KB
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
Enter passphrase: 
  embedded file "secret.txt":
    size: 27.0 Byte
    encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc
    compressed: yes
```

This output is excellent! It tells us:
*   We are using the right tool.
*   The password is correct.
*   The hidden file is named `secret.txt`.

### **Step 3: Extract the Hidden File**

Now that we've confirmed everything, let's extract the file. Use the `steghide extract` command.

*   `-sf` specifies the stego file (the image).
*   `-p` lets you provide the password directly in the command.

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
steghide extract -sf challenge_image.jpg -p AlphaEcho7
```

After running the command, you will see a confirmation message:

```
wrote extracted data to "secret.txt".
```

Now, if you list the files in your current directory (using the `ls` command), you will see a new file named `secret.txt`.

### **Step 4: Reveal the Flag**

The final step is to read the contents of the file you just extracted. You can use the `cat` command for this.

```bash
cat secret.txt
```

The terminal will display the contents of the file, which is the flag:

```
CTF{sT3g0_h1d3_aNd_s33k}
```

**Congratulations, you have solved the challenge!**
