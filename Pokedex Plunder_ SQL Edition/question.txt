Story:
 Disaster! Team Rocket has stolen Professor Oak’s prototype Pokédex and locked it away in their digital vault. But Team Rocket’s web security is as flimsy as a Caterpie’s String Shot! Professor Oak managed to hide a secret flag inside the database before it was stolen. Your mission as a Trainer: infiltrate Team Rocket’s Pokédex system and retrieve the hidden flag to prove your skills to the Professor!
Your Challenge:
 Team Rocket’s login portal guards the Pokédex. But rumor has it that Team Rocket’s login is vulnerable to a classic SQL-type move.
Visit the login portal and try to bypass Team Rocket’s checks.
