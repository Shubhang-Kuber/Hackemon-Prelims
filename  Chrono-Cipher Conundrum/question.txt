Chrono-Cipher Conundrum

Category: Web Exploitation / Reverse Engineering / Timing Attacks  
Difficulty: Very Hard

Description:
You've stumbled upon an experimental temporal synchronization interface.
Legend has it, a secret flag is locked behind the Chronos Gate, protected by layers of time-sensitive protocols and unseen echoes from the past.

The interface appears simple, but the truth is hidden beyond the visible spectrum.
To retrieve the flag, you must meticulously interact with the system, decode its ephemeral whispers, and achieve perfect temporal resonance.

Your Mission: Discover the hidden flag.

Hints to guide your temporal journey:

Phase 1: The Ephemeral Anomaly  
- The truth is fleeting — it appears only for a fraction of a second.  
- Human eyes might not be fast enough.  
- What loads on the page... and when?

Phase 2: Resonating with the Past  
- Sending feedback is not enough — your message needs the right temporal signature.  
- Some parts of a request are invisible to the naked eye.  
- How do web requests carry hidden information?

Phase 3: The Chronos Gate's Swift Guard  
- The final lock requires precise synchronization.  
- The timing window is extremely narrow.  
- Can you automate your steps to achieve perfect timing?

Flag Format: HACKEMON{CHRONO_FLARE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX}
