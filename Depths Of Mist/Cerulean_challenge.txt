Depths of Mist

Welcome to the grand stage of the Cerulean City Gym — where the tides hide more than just Water-types.
You may lead now, but legends whisper of those who came before, leaving riddles in the current and secrets in the deep.
The tide carries secrets…
To reach the depths, you must ride with one who churns the seas in rage and ruin. Feared more than adored, A splash turned storm, once born from pity.
Whisper his name, and the lock may break.

You're given a single image. The rest lies… beneath the surface.
