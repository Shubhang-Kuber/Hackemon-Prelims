Team Rocketâ€™s vault is captured in an image split into sixteen quadrants by thick black lines crossing in a 4x4 grid, each quadrant containing a unique number of golden coins scattered randomly; your challenge is to count the coins in each quadrant and combine these numbers in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order to unlock the hidden code, which you must submit in the format hackemon{decoded_string}.
