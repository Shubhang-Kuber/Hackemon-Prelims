Team Rocket has been spotted at a famous restaurant in Lumiose City, but they’ve left only an image as a clue! As a Trainer, your mission is to identify the restaurant from the image, then find the name of the nearest metro station—all without a map or list of stations.

Challenge
You are given an image of a restaurant.
Your task is to:
Identify the name of the restaurant shown in the image.
Find the name of the nearest metro station to that restaurant.

Submit your answer in the following flag format:
hackemon{restaurantname+metrostationname}
(Use lowercase and remove spaces in both names for your submission.)

Example:
If the restaurant is Rameshwaram Cafe and the nearest metro station is MG Road, your flag would be:
hackemon{rameshwaramcafe+mgroad}
